Molecules of M bind to form E, and E dissociates back into two Ms. Additionally, E and S can bind to form ES, which then dissociates back into E and S, while E and P can bind to form EP, which dissociates back into E and P. Furthermore, ES can be converted into E and P. E and I can also bind to form EI, which dissociates back into E and I. Finally, EI is converted into EJ.
