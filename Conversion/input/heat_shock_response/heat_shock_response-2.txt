mRNA_s32 is upregurated by Pg_s70_RNAP. Similarly, mRNA_DnaK and mRNA_FtsH are positively regulated by Ph_RNAP_s32. mRNA_Protein is transcribed without regulation. s32, FtsH, DnaK, and Pfold are translated from mRNA_s32, mRNA_FtsH, mRNA_DnaK, and mRNA_Protein, respectively. All the mRNAs (mRNA_s32, mRNA_DnaK, mRNA_FtsH, and mRNA_Protein) decay. s32, s32_DnaK, s32_FtsH, s32_DnaK_FtsH, FtsH, DnaK, Punfold_DnaK, Pfold, and Punfold decay. RNAP_s32 is degraded into RNAP. Similarly, Ph_RNAP_s32 is degraded into Ph and RNAP. D_RNAP_s32 is degraded into RNAP_D.
