s70 and RNA polymerase (RNAP) bind together to form s70_RNAP, which then dissociates into s70 and RNAP. Pg and s70_RNAP bind to create Pg_s70_RNAP, which can dissociate back into its components. RNAP and s32 bind to create RNAP_s32, which can dissociate into RNAP and s32. Ph and RNAP_s32 bind to form Ph_RNAP_s32, which then dissociates back into Ph and RNAP_s32. Additionally, s32 and DnaK form s32_DnaK, which can dissociate into s32 and DnaK, while s32 and FtsH bind to create s32_FtsH, which can dissociate back into s32 and FtsH. Similarly, Punfold and DnaK bind to form Punfold_DnaK, which can dissociate into Punfold and DnaK. D and s70_RNAP bind to form D_s70_RNAP, which can dissociate into D and s70_RNAP, and D and RNAP_s32 bind to form D_RNAP_s32, which can dissociate into D and RNAP_s32. RNAP and D bind to form RNAP_D, and RNAP_D can dissociate into RNAP and D. s32_DnaK and FtsH bind to form s32_DnaK_FtsH, which then dissociates into s32_DnaK and FtsH. s32_FtsH is converted into FtsH, while s32_DnaK_FtsH is converted into DnaK and FtsH. Similarly, Pfold is converted into Punfold, while Punfold_DnaK is converted into Pfold and DnaK.
